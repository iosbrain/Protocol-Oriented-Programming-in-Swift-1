# Protocol Oriented Programming in Swift, Part 1 of 2
Here are two Xcode 9 playgrounds written in Swift 4 that highlight protocol oriented programming and value semantics.

`Protocol Polymorphism.playground` demonstrates polymorphism inherent in Swift's protocols.

`Generic List.playground` shows you how to build generic data structures in Swift -- a queue and a stack that can contain **any** type. It also demonstrates how you can build powerful protocols by inheriting from other ones without the interference you'd get from class inheritance.
